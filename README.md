# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis

This project explores the Titanic dataset to uncover key factors that influenced passenger survival during the tragic voyage of 1912. It serves as a beginner-friendly data analysis case study using Python.

## 📌 Problem Statement

To analyze passenger data from the Titanic and identify the key features that contributed to their chances of survival.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- **Source:** [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- **Rows:** 891  
- **Features:** Age, Sex, Pclass, Fare, Embarked, SibSp, Parch, etc.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

- Handled missing values in `Age`, `Embarked`, and dropped `Cabin`
- Converted categorical variables to numerical (`Sex`, `Embarked`)
- Removed irrelevant columns (`Ticket`, `Name`, `Cabin`)

---

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Survival rate comparison by gender and class
- Age distribution of survivors vs non-survivors
- Relationship between fare paid and survival
- Embarked location and its impact on survival

---

## 🧠 Correlation Analysis

A correlation heatmap revealed:
- Strong relationship between **Sex** and **Survival**
- First-class passengers had better survival chances
- Fare showed moderate positive correlation with survival

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Females** had a significantly higher chance of survival
- **First-class** passengers were prioritized during evacuation
- **Younger passengers** had slightly better survival odds

---

## 📌 Conclusion

This analysis highlights how social and economic factors influenced survival during the Titanic disaster. It also lays the groundwork for predictive modeling and deeper analysis.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional)

- Build and test machine learning models for survival prediction
- Deploy results via an interactive dashboard (e.g., Streamlit or Power BI)
